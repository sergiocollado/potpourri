# Notes on software architecture

The software architecture of a system is a high-level description of the system's structure, its different components, 
and how those components communicate with each other to fullfill the system's requirements and constraints. 

## System requirements and arquitectural drivers

Requirements gathering steps:
 - identify all the actors/users in the system
 - describe all the possible user-case or scenarios of the system
 - get each user-case, and detail the flow of events or interactions between the user and the system
    - Each event contains:
        - Action
        - Data

A good way to represent interactions is with a sequence diagram. 

Also is common to UML (Unified Modeling Language).
