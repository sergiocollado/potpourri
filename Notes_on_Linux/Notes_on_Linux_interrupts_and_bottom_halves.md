# Notes on Linux interrupt and bottom halves

## What is an interrupt?

An interrupt is an input signal to the processor, sent by the hardware peripherals when they need processor attention. 

## What is the purpose of the interrupts?

For example, if we want to perform an action with an incomming packet from the network card as soon as the packet arrives.

If you don't want to continously ask the network card "has any packet arrive yet?" and waste processor time, you
can use external hardware interrupt IRQ

The interrupt line from a device should be connected to the INTR line of the CPU, and after each packet is received,
the network card will make a signal over this line. 

The CPU will sense this line and know that the network card has information for it.

Only after that, the CPU will read the incoming packet. 

## Types of interrupt

1. - Hardware / asynchronous:
     - Generated by hw devices
     - Occours at arbitrary times (asynchronous) with respect to the clock signals
     - examples: processing of a key on the keyboard, mouse movement, timer fired, network card reporting arrival of a packet...
2. - Software / synchronous:
     - Generated by executing instructions
     - occous synchronously with respect to processor clock
     - also called as exceptions/traps
     - examples: divide-by-zero, system call, page fault
