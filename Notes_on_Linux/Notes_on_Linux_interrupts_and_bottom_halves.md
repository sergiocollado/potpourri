# Notes on Linux interrupt and bottom halves

reference: https://linux-kernel-labs.github.io/refs/heads/master/lectures/interrupts.html#interrupt-handling-in-linux

### What is an interrupt?

An interrupt is an input signal to the processor, sent by the hardware peripherals when they need processor attention. 

### What is the purpose of the interrupts?

For example, if we want to perform an action with an incomming packet from the network card as soon as the packet arrives.

If you don't want to continously ask the network card "has any packet arrive yet?" and waste processor time, you
can use external hardware interrupt IRQ

The interrupt line from a device should be connected to the INTR line of the CPU, and after each packet is received,
the network card will make a signal over this line. 

The CPU will sense this line and know that the network card has information for it.

Only after that, the CPU will read the incoming packet. 

### Types of interrupt

1. - Hardware / asynchronous:
     - Generated by hw devices
     - Occours at arbitrary times (asynchronous) with respect to the clock signals
     - Examples: processing of a key on the keyboard, mouse movement, timer fired, network card reporting arrival of a packet...
2. - Software / synchronous:
     - Generated by executing instructions
     - Occorus synchronously with respect to processor clock
     - Also called as exceptions/traps
     - Examples: divide-by-zero, system call, page fault
    
### Exceptions

Exceptions are classified as faults, traps, and abort, depending on the way they are reported and whether the instruction 
that caused the exception can be restared, without loss of programs. 

Traps increment the instruction pointer, faults don't, and aborts "explode". 

- Faults: These can be corrected and the programmer may continue as if nothing happened. Eg. page fault 
- Traps: Traps are reported inmediately after the execution of the trapping instruction. Eg. int instruction
- Aborts: Some severe unrecoverable error. Eg. hardware failure

### General protection Fault

A general protection fault may occur for various reasons, the most common:

- segment error (privilege, type, limit, read/write rights).
- executing priviledged instructions while CPL (current privilege level) is not equal to 0.
- writing a 1 in a reserved register field.
- referencing or accessing a null-descriptor.
- trying to access an unimlemented register (like mov cr6, eax)
- the saved instruction pointer points to the instruction which causes the exception

#### Example 1
So for example for a divide by zero problem:

```c
  // divide_by_zero.c
  1 #include <stdio.h>                                                               
  2                                                                                  
  3 int main()                                                                       
  4 {                                                                                
  5 »       int i = 1/0;                                                             
  6 »       return 0;                                                                
  7 }                                                                                 
```

```bash
sergio@laptop:~/repos/divide-by-zero$ gcc -o div_by_zero.c divide_by_zero.c 
divide_by_zero.c: In function ‘main’:
divide_by_zero.c:5:18: warning: division by zero [-Wdiv-by-zero]
    5 |         int i = 1/0;
      |           
```
what should happen here?

```bash
sergio@laptop:~/repos/divide-by-zero$ ls
div_by_zero.c  divide_by_zero.c
sergio@laptop:~/repos/divide-by-zero$ sudo dmesg -WH &
[1] 6310
sergio@laptop:~/repos/divide-by-zero$ ./div_by_zero.c 
[oct 8 16:43] traps: div_by_zero.c[6315] trap divide error ip:55d9a6c7b13c sp:7ffc0f832c10 error:0 in div_by_zero.c[55d9a6c7b000+1000]
Floating point exception (core dumped)
```

#### Example 2

```c
  //  userapp.c 
  1 #include <stdio.h>                                                               
  2 #include </usr/include/sys/io.h>                                                 
  3                                                                                  
  4 int main()                                                                       
  5 {                                                                                
  6 »       outb(0x80, 0x00);                                                        
  7 »       return 0;                                                                
  8 }   
```

```
sergio@laptop:~/repos/divide-by-zero$ gcc -o userapp userapp.c 
sergio@laptop:~/repos/divide-by-zero$ sudo dmesg -WH &
sergio@laptop:~/repos/divide-by-zero$ ./userapp
[oct 8 19:56] show_signal: 1 callbacks suppressed
[  +0,000006] traps: userapp[4589] general protection fault ip:55c13b8c4140 sp:7fff1bd28c70 error:0 in userapp[55c13b8c4000+1000]
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
```

In this case we are attemping to write to a memory that it is now allow, we don't have access writes, so a general protection fault is triggered.


We can see it should be a fault, but in linux is denominated as a trap. 

### How debuggers work?

To implement breakpoints on the x86 architecture, software interrupts (also known as "traps") are used.

Breakpoints are implemented on the CPU by a special trap called int 3.

int is 0x86 jargon for "trap instruction" - a call to a predefined interrupts handler. 

x86 supports the int instruction with a 8-bit operand specifying the number of the interrupt that occurred.

```c
  1 #include <stdio.h>                                                               
  2                                                                                  
  3 int main() {                                                                     
  4 »       int i = 0;                                                               
  5 »       while (i < 6) {                                                          
  6 »       »       printf("i equals to: %d\n", i);                                  
  7 »       »       ++i;                                                             
  8 »       }                                                                        
  9 »       __asm__("int3");                                                         
 10 }                                                                                            
```

```bash
sergio@laptop:~/repos/divide-by-zero$ gcc -o int3 interrupt.c 
sergio@laptop:sudo dmesg -WH &
i equals to: 0
i equals to: 1
i equals to: 2

```

but if we debug the program with gcc: 

```
sergio@laptop:~/repos/divide-by-zero$ gdb ./int3
