# Notes on timers and time management on the Linux Kernel


## Hz

The Linux's kernel works on timer interrupts. The frequency of the timer interrupt is defined on system boot on the preprocessor `define HZ`

So if HZ = 100, the frequency would be 100Hz, so the interrupt happens every 1/100 seconds, that is 100ms. 

The value of `HZ` changes for every architecture.
