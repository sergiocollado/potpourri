Uninformed search, refers to the fact that the intelligent agent, doen't know in advance the searching space. 

For representing the searching space, usually a tree structure (root, branches and leafs) are used.

There are several common methods to use:

- Breath first search (BFS) - expands the shallowest node
- Depth-first search (DFS) - expands the deepest node.
- Uniform cost search - expands the less expensive node.
