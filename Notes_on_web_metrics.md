# Notes on web metrics

I wanted my [website](https://sergiocollado.github.io/) indexed at google, so i found this reference:

http://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/66799/how-can-i-have-a-public-searchable-github-account

You can actually request an indexing at: https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/submit-url

Then I found about the googles webmaster site:  https://www.google.com/webmasters/#?modal_active=none

It recommended my to do the following actions:

1- add website versions, that is: www http https
2- select your preferred version
3- select your target country
4- share access with co-workers
5- submit a filesite map
