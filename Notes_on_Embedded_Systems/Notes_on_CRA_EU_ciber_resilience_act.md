The Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) is a new European Union law that sets cybersecurity requirements for digital products. 
Even if youâ€™re not based in the EU, the CRA may still apply if your software reaches the EU market.

The law introduces strict rules across the product lifecycle and includes significant penalties for non-compliance. 
Key provisions take effect in June 2026, with full enforcement in December 2027, giving organizations limited time to prepare.

Cyberatacks represent a matter of public interest as they have critical impact
 - not only on the EU economy.
 - but also in democracy as well as consumer safety and health.

Aims for the development of secure products and digital elements [PDEs] by ensuring that hardware and software products are placed on the market

 - CRA focus: cybersecurity of any "product with digital elements" (PDE)
 - Non included: Non-commercial, websites, services without product

    - If purpose/foreseeable use has data connection (common!)
    - some specialty cases with their own regulation excluded (e.g. medical devices, motor vehicles)
 - Digital technology - including software is global.
 - Impact of Open source (OSS) significally reduced from initial proposal. Open source is non-commercial, so it is not included :)

### Key terms 

 - PDE "product with digital elements"
 - making available on the market: the supply of a PDE in the EU
 - market surveillance: ensure the products comply with legistlation and protection of the public
 - market surveillance authority: and authority designated to do market surveillance
