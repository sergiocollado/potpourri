**EMBEDDED SYSTEM**: An embedded system is a system, that combines software and hardware, either fixed in capabilities or programmable, that
is designed for a specified function or functions. Common examples are industrial equiments and machines, agricultural, automotive, medical, aeronautical or space systems, or even household apliances, toys or vending machines...

**ACCIDENT**: The action of causing/receiving damage of some kind: equipment damage, human injuries or even deaths.

**RISK**: Combination of the likehood on an accident and its severity.   Risk = p(accident) * severity(accident)

**HAZARD**: Set of combinations or requisites or events that lead to an accident

**ERROR/MISTAKE**: A human being can make an error(mistake), with procudes a defect (fault, bug) in the program or code, or in a document.  If a defect in code is executed, the system amy fail to do what it shoud do, what it should do (or do something it shouldnt)
causing a failure. Defects in software, systms or documnets may result in failures, bot no all defects do.

**FAILURE**: Is the misperformance of a system or component
  
**ERROR**: A systematic fault, caused by a design error

**RA**: Risk Assestment: Is the analisys to identify and determine the possible situations or conditions that may end in an accident, thus 
there is a thread(hazard). If the risk assesment is quantitative, it needs two factors: the Risk(R) = magnitude of the potencial lost (L)
and the probability (p) that lost happens.

Ri = Li * p(Li);

**RELIABILITY**: Is the probability that a piece of equipment or component or component will perform correctly its intended goal, inside the defined time, and under the correct enviroment.

Reliability is often quantified with the merit figure of MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures) 

**AVAILABILITY**: Is the probability that the system will be working/performing as expected at any given time.

Availability is often quantified by 1-MTTR / MTTF 

where:

**MTTR** stands for Mean Time To Repair the system

and 

**MTTF** stands for Mean Time To Failure

**FAILURE**: A failure is misperformance or lack of hability of a component to comply with its designed function, during certain
time, or under specified enviromental system conditions.

**ERROR**: An error is a desing flaw or desviation from an intended or designed state.
