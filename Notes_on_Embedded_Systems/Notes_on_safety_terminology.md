ERROR: A systematic fault, caused by a design error

RA: Risk Assestment: Is the analisys to identify and determine the possible situations or conditions that may end in an accident, thus 
there is a thread(hazard). If the risk assesment is quantitative, it needs two factors: the Risk(R) = magnitude of the potencial lost (L)
and the probability (p) that lost happens.

Ri = Li * p(Li);
