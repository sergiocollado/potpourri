INTRO TO XAMARIN:
================

FOREWORD:
· This are my personal notes, on the EDX/MICROSOFT course: DEV215x Introduction to Xamarin.Forms- the aim of this docuent,
is to clarify my ideas, by means of writting them down, and have a resource where quickly find answers to my doubs, based on
my experience. 

INTRO:
  Xamarin, is platform, for cross-developing applications for iOS, Android, and Windows, based in .NET, and programmed in C#.
  
NOTE: There are also a collection of MS courses at: https://mva.microsoft.com/
NOTE: Is adviced knwoldege of C#, and XAML markup languaje.

INTRODUCTION TO THE DIFFERENT WAYS TO BUILD MOBILE APPLICATIONS:
================================================================

SILO APPROACH: An application is written for multiple platforms, using the native development tools, that means, developing the same 
application for each platform, as a pro: you can take advantage to all the properties of that platform, as a con: you are going to 
generate different bugs in each platform. 

- View: Android Studio.

BLACK BOX APPROACH: You develop an application and somehow you produce native code for all the targeted plataforms. Pros: Usually the initial 
application is done in HTML and JS, so a web developer can fill the bill. Cons: You can only access to the features common to all the 
platfomrs, so you cannot take advantage of each platform features, or even last features.

- View: APACHE / CORDOVA.

XAMARIN APPROACH: With Xamarin you develop in C# and .NET so you can take advante of all the lenguaje features (LINQ, Async Wait,
Generics, Delegates, Tasks...) , and use all the specific features of each platform. 

XAMARIN SOFTWARE TOOLS:
=======================

Developent:
    - Visual Studio
    - Xamarin Studio.

Testing:
    - Xamarin profiler (identify hotspots).
    - Xamarin Test Cloud (let you find bugs, by scripting automatic user interfaces, to run
      localy or upload them to the cloud and run them on hundreds of physical devices.

Monitoring:
    - Xamarin Insights: for real time application monitoring, and generation of crash reports.

START AND SETTING UP:
=====================

Go to Xamarin.com and dowload, go to the platform option 

Xamarin.com > Products > Xamaring Platform > Download

It will download the file: vstoolsforxamarin.exe

Install when ready. The installation program requires 34,05 GB¡! - up to more than 43GGB¡!-- Oh, God!!! 
--Also it takes its time to load.
    
Xamarin.Forms is a software that allows to design at once a UI for Android, iOS, and MS.
