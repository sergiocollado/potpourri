# Notes on databases


In 1986, SQL (Structured Query Language) became a standard. Over the next 40 years, it became the dominant language for relational database management systems. Reading the latest standard (ANSI SQL 2016) can be time-consuming. 

There are 5 components of the SQL language:

 - DDL: data definition language, such as CREATE, ALTER, DROP
 - DQL: data query language, such as SELECT
 - DML: data manipulation language, such as INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
 - DCL: data control language, such as GRANT, REVOKE
 - TCL: transaction control language, such as COMMIT, ROLLBACK
