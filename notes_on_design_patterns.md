# Notes on design patterns

Usually design patterns are classified into three categories:

- Behavioral
- Structural
- Creational


They are:

## Behavioral

How do OBJECTS OF A CLASS behave and interact with each other

- Strategy
- Iterator
- Template
- Command
- Memento
- Visitor
- State
- Mediator
- Observer

## Structural

How do CLASSES behave and interact with each other

- Decorator
- Adapter
- Facade
- Composite
- Flyweight
- Bridge
- Proxy

## Creational

They focus on how objects are constructed. They usually aim to decouple how objects are created, from its use. That is to hide the 
implementation of an object, from its use, and only reveal its interface. Other reason to use the creational patterns, is that
there is a need to use families of related objects together. And another reason, is to limit the number of objects that are created.
