Mobile communications evolution


It started with AMPS (Advanced Mobile Phone System)  this was the first generation of mobile cellular phone systems. This used an Analog technology based in FDMA (Frequency Division Multiple Access), it was developed by Bell Labs (1983): 

The second generation was GSM (Global system for Mobile Communications) and it was based in digital electronics. (1991). It allows for TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) and FDMA at the same time. And like it is based in digital systems, is more robust against interferences. GSM had voice communications, but also data transfer up to 9.6 kbps, and SMS (Short Message Service), and used SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) cards, that contain the user subscription information and phone books. 

The next evolution is the IS-95 (Interim Standard -1995) which is the first 2G with CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) that improves the performance against interference of other devices and signal fading (multipath). It supports voice and data up to 14.4 kbps

Next follows UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunication System), this is the 3G. It is supported by UTRA (UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access) that supports several terrestrial interfaces. Multi-user access in UTRA can be done by UTRA-FDD (Frequency Division Duplex)  or UTRA-TDD (Time Division Duplex); follows WCDMA (Wideband Code Division Multiple Access) based in UTRA-FDD. The data rate in 3Gpp ( 3rd Generation Partnership Project) reaches up to 2 Mbps (release 99): 

UMTS evolves for faster packet speeds in the HSDPA (High Speed Downlink Packet Access). Downlink means from the base station to the mobile device. The data rates reach 14 Mbps. Next came the HSDPA+ (Evolved High Speed Downlink Packet Access) is the first time MIMO (usage of multiple antennas) and a 64 QAM, is used. 

The next technology leap is LTE (Long Term Evolution). Its peak data rate is (release 8) downlink 300 Mbps  and uplink 65 Mbps. From its evolution LTE-A (LTE Advanced) is considered already as 4G. With data rates as downlink 3 Gbps  and uplink 1.5 Gbps
