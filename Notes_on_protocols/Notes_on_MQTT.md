# NOTES ON MQTT

## Overview

MQTT is publish/subscribe messaging transport protocol. Its light, open, simple, and designed to be easy to implement. This make it perfect for constrained applications, as those required for M2M (Machine to Machine) comunications, and IoT (Internet of Things)- there a small code footprint is required, and the network bandwidth is scarce.
