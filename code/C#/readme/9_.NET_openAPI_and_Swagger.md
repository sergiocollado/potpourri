# OpenAPI (Swagger) Integration

## Introduction
Integrating Swagger with ASP.NET Core provides a streamlined way to automatically generate and maintain up-to-date API documentation,
making it easier for developers to understand, test, and interact with APIs. This integration uses the Swashbuckle library to enable
interactive documentation directly within an ASP.NET Core application.

## Key Steps for Integration

### Install Packages:

Add Swashbuckle.AspNetCore and Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi packages. These packages enable the setup and generation of Swagger documentation.

### Configure Services:

Use `builder.Services.AddEndpointsApiExplorer()` to register API endpoints.

Use `builder.Services.AddSwaggerGen()` to generate Swagger documentation in an OpenAPI format.

Enable Middleware for Swagger in Development:

Within a development-only if statement (app.Environment.IsDevelopment()), add:

`app.UseSwagger()` to produce the Swagger JSON document.

`app.UseSwaggerUI()` to create a visual interface for browsing and testing endpoints.

Enhance Documentation with Custom Descriptions:

Use `.WithOpenApi()` to add summaries and descriptions to endpoints for clarity.

Use `.Produces<StatusCode>` to define response types, improving accuracy and readability.

### Test API Routes with Swagger UI:

Access the Swagger UI at /swagger to test endpoints.

Use `.ExcludeFromDescription()` to hide internal routes, keeping the documentation focused on essential endpoints.

### Conclusion
Following these steps, Swagger can be integrated into ASP.NET Core applications to create dynamic, interactive,
and easily accessible API documentation. This integration simplifies the development process, saves time, and helps ensure documentation aligns with API functionality.
