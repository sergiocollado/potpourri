# make file for the reverse polish notation calculator. v3

# remeber to use tabs!!

# the rules in 'make' has the following format:

# target: [dependecies]
# \tab command

#make is aware of the rules form compiling C code, so
#it is no needed to specify the .c files.

CC = gcc
OBJECTS = stack.o getop.o getch.o

polishcalc : main.o $(OBJECTS)
	$(CC) -o polishcalc  main.o $(OBJECTS)
main.o: calc.h
stack.o: calc.h
getop.o: calc.h
getch.o:


#you can create a rule for 'clean', so in this way
#it is avoided confusion in case a file is named 'clean'.

.PHONY: clean
	clean : 
	rm polishcalc main.o $(OBJETCS)

# to compile with the deafult makefile, only run 'make'.
# to view the compile commands, use: 'make -n'
# to compile with another file, use: 'make -f anotherfile'
