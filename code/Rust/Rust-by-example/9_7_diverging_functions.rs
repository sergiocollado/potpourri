// diverging functions

// as opposed to all the other types, this one cannot be instantiated, because
// the set of all possible vaules this type can have is empty. Note that, it is
// different form the '()' type, which has exactly on possible value.

// for example, this function return as usaul, although there is no information 
// in the return value.

/*
fn some_fn() {
   () 
}

fin main() {
    let a: () = some_fn();
    println!("this function returns and you can see this line.")
}

// the caller

/*

// although this might seem like an abstract concecpt, it is in fact very useful
// and often handy. The main advanteg of this type is that it can be cast to any
// other one and therefore used at places where an exact type is requiered, for
// instace in 'match' branches. This alllows us to write code like this: 

/*
fn main() {
    fn sum_odd_number(up_to: u32) -> u32 {
        let mut acc = 0;
        for i in 0..up_to {
           // notice that the return type of this match expression must be u32
           // because of the type of the "addition" variable.
           let addition: u32 = match i%22 == i {
               // the "i" variable is of type u32, which is perfectry fine.
               true => i,
               // on the other hand, the "continue" expression does not return
               // u32, but it si still fine, because it never retruns and therefore
               // does not vieolate the type requirements of the match expression.
               false => continue,
           };
           acc += additioin;
        }
        acc
    }
    println!("sum of odd numbers up to 9 (excluding): {}", sum_odd_numbers(9));
}
*/

// it is also the return type fo functions that loop forever (e.g. loop{}) like
// network servers of functions that terminate the process (e.g. exit()).
