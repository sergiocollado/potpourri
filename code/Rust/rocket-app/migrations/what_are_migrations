Database migrations, also known as schema migrations, database schema migrations, or simply migrations, are controlled sets of changes developed to modify the structure of the objects within a relational database. Migrations help transition database schemas from their current state to a new desired state, whether that involves adding tables and columns, removing elements, splitting fields, or changing types and constraints.

Migrations manage incremental, often reversible, changes to data structures in a programmatic way. The goals of database migration software are to make database changes repeatable, shareable, and testable without loss of data. Generally, migration software produces artifacts that describe the exact set of operations required to transform a database from a known state to the new state. These can be checked into and managed by normal version control software to track changes and share among team members.

While preventing data loss is generally one of the goals of migration software, changes that drop or destructively modify structures that currently house data can result in deletion. To cope with this, migration is often a supervised process involving inspecting the resulting change scripts and making any modifications necessary to preserve important information.
