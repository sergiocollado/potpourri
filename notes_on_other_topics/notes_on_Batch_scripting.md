# NOTES ON BATCH SCRIPTING

Batch scripting is a way to automate repetitive tasks, and it is a good practice, since it prevents from human failures, well, at least as long as when the script works as expected ; )
Actually the meaning of a ‘Batch process’, is a series of process or tasks, to be done without human intervention. They can be launched at any time or scheduled.

For launching the ‘console’ or also known as ‘shell’,  you need to press at the same time the [Windows logo key] + R 

Then it will appear:

It is also possible to launch it from the start menu:

And there you have the console, also known as the command shell:

The command shell is a separate program that provides direct communication between the user and the operating system. 
The non-graphical command shell user interface provides the environment in which you run character-based applications and 
utilities trough the use of commands. The command shell executes instructions and programs and displays their output on the screen


It is also possible to make an icon to launch it.

In Windows, the batch files have the extension ‘.cmd’ some really old systems, even used the ‘bat’. - that extension file is not recommended anymore.

For creating, writing and editing batch files you can use any editor of your choice. But remember that the encoding should be ANSI.

To run a batch file, you can just double-click on it, and it will be executed. And the command screen will disappear as soon as the script is finished.

You can also run it from the console, for that you have to go to the folder where it is stored, or add it to PATH environment variable.  

## List of commands

To get the list of commands, you just need to type the command: `>help`
