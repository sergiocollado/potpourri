## **ℰlectricity**: 
Electricity is an energy asociated with the phenomenon of the flow and accumulation of electrons (negative charged particles)
oposed to protons (positive charged particles).

## **ℰlectrostatics**:
Is the study of the electric phenomenon, when the different charges: electrons (by convention, negatively charged)
and protons (by convention, positive charged) are in an static equilibrium - that is: they are not moving with respect each others.

Electrostatics is govern by _**𝒞oulomb's Law**_ that enunciates as folows:

## _**𝒞oulomb's Law**_  

The force **F** between two charged particles (Q_1 and Q_2) in static equilibrium, in a given medium,
is proportional to the product of it's charges, and inversely proportional o the square of it's distance (R^2). 
If Q_1 and Q_2 have the same sign, that is: both positive or both negative, the force will be of
repulsion, driving them appart. If Q_1 and Q_2 have opposite signs, the force will be of attraction. 
That force will act always along the line that is defined by the position of both charged particles
Q_1 and Q_2 (vector r). That force will be also proportional to a constant **k_e**, in the Internationa
System of units, **SI**, it has the value:

>   **k_e = 1 / (4·π·ε)**
     
Where **ε** is the absolutely permittivity of the medium (althought for symplicity many times is just 
call _**permittivity**_, for short); the absolutely permittivity value is given by:

>   **ε= ε_r·ε_0**
    
where:

- **ε_r** is a dimension less quantity, that is known as the _**relative permittivity**_ of also as the _**dielectric constant**
_ of the medium.
- **ε_0** is the permittivity of free space (vacuum) - and its value is:

>  **ε_0= 10^(-9)/(36·π)**

So for free space, the relative permittivity is ε_r = 1.

Then the force between the two charges Q_1 and Q_2, is defined by:

> _**F**_ = k_e·Q_1·Q_2·_**r**_/(R^2)   [Newtons]
