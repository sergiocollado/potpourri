What exactly is the light is something really difficult, and it took scientist quite a time to get the knowledge we have today. There are a 
actually three main models that are acknoledge for representing the light, being the easiest one the ray-model. We will discuss it next.

First of all, we may consider what make as to see the world, what make us able to see. Well the answer is pretty straight foward, we
are able to see because there are objects that emitt light, as for example the Sun, or bulbs, although there are other kinds of light emission
based on other principles as fluerescence, ...

So, we can consider that from a light emitting object, the light moves in straight rays outwards. The light moves straint but when it
finds a change in the enviroment it moves, as when it goes through air, and then it finds a window, it is a change in the material it goes
through, then three things can happen:

- transmission: the light travels through the new material
- absortion: the light diffusses through the material.
- reflection: the light "bounces", at the new material.

# Transmission:


# Absortion:


# Reflection:
