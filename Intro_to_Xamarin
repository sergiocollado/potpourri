INTRO TO XAMARIN by SERGIO GONZÁLEZ COLLADO
============================================

FOREWORD:
· This are my personal notes, on the EDX/MICROSOFT course: DEV215x Introduction to Xamarin.Forms- the finality of this docuent,
is to clarify my ideas, and have a resource where quickly find answers to my doubs, based on my experience. 

INTRO:
  Xamarin, is platform, for cross-developing applications for iOS, Android, and Windows, based in .Net, and programmed in C#.
  
NOTE: Is adviced knwoldege of C#, and XAML markup languaje.

INTRODUCTION TO THE DIFFERENT WAYS TO BUILD MOBILE APPLICATIONS:
================================================================

SILO APPROACH: An application is written for multiple platforms, using the native development tools, that means, developing the same 
application for each platform, as a pro: you can take advantage to all the properties of that platform, as a con: you are going to 
generate different bugs in each platform. 

- View: Android Studio.

BLACK BOX APPROACH: You develop an application and somehow you produce native code for all the targeted plataforms. Pros: Usually the initial 
application is done in HTML and JS, so a web developer can fill the bill. Cons: You can only access to the features common to all the 
platfomrs, so you cannot take advantage of each platform features, or even last features.

- View: APACHE / CORDOVA.

XAMARIN APPROACH: With Xamarin you develop in C# and .NET so you can take advante of all the lenguaje features (LINQ, Async Wait, Generics,
Delegates, Tasks...) , and use all the specific features of each platform.
