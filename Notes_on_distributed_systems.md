## What is a distributed system?

A distributed system, is a system which is not centralized on a single computer. So it is divided over several computer. 

This has some advantages:
- more robust, can tolerate failures of the computers that compose the system.
- more scalable, can suppport many user

As a disadvange: it is more complex. 

Due distrubuted systems are complex, are considered an advanced topic in computer science.

## Why build a distributed system?

- Scaling
- Reliability
- Dependency on th ecloud
- performance (latency/bandwidth)
- uptime requirments
