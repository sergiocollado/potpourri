STORING POLICIES:
There are three ways to store policies:
 · Standard ( "11 9's") - that means that if you have 1 million files stored there, you will loose one, everty 10.000 years.
   · it comes at greatest cost, but is the default.
 · Reduced Redundancy Storage (RRS) - is ("4 9s") - it means that if you have 10000 files there, you'll probable loose one every year.
   · It cost is reduced about 20% / Great for reproducible assets
   · RRS, can trigger notifications, on "object missing". 
 · Glaciar it has ("11 9's), but is great draw back is queued retrieval -you cannot get it back in real time- 
   · But is cost is about the 10% of the standard option - which make a great choise for arcivals, and back-ups.
